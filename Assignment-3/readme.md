<h1>This is the 3rd assignment of OS(2024)</h1>

In this we have implemented the updated shell (with added functionality like & and adding processes) to the scheduler.

You can submit a process to be schedule with the syntax
submit ./fib.out <priority> 
where prioirty is a number and it can be leaved blank too which would mean by default.

A process with higher priority value gets higher priority
