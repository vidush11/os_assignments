<h1> This is the 5th assignment for the Operating systems course</h1>

In this we have implemented general multithreading over a for loop and 2 for loops (nested) by splitting the work into n threads. You can have any sort of lambda function for performing the work, but the iterations in for loop shouldn't depend on one another.

We have used pthread.h library in cpp.
